### [#2. Loading Views](http://www.backbonerails.com/screencasts/loading-views)

#### Description
Loading views are a great way to provide instant feedback to user's when their page is loading. In some circumstances, they become a necessary building block in the development of your application. How do you display this page while your app is fetching resources from the server? What if your application logic is still processing data that this page needs to display?

In this screencast, we'll build a fully functioning loading component using Backbone.js and Marionette.js. We'll answer how to handle old views when new views are requested. We'll also look at some common pitfalls that can cause memory leaks when handling view logic. Lastly we'll experiment with different kinds of loading effects and transitions.
